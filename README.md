### Description

This project expands on the ludobots course found on Reddit. In this project, I have created a robot "dog" that has the goal of pushing a box as far as possible within a certain time frame. Along with creating the robot and box for it to push, I have modified the evolution algorithm to select the top robots of all the parent and children (i.e. top 10 performing robots of the 10 parents and 10 children).

### Running The Code

In order to run the code, download all of the files along with any libraries from import statements, then simply run the command 'python3 search.py' and watch the robot evolve. Change constants such as 'numberOfGenerations' and 'populationSize' depending on your computers performance to see different results.
