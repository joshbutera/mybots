### Description

This project expands on the ludobots course found on Reddit. In this project, I have created a robot "snake" that generates a kinematic chain (a jointed, motorized, innervated, sensorized snake). The snake will have a random amount of links with random sizes, and random sensor placements along the chain (links colored green have sensors and links colored blue do not have sensors).

### Running The Code

In order to run the code, download all of the files along with any libraries from import statements, then simply run the command 'python3 main.py' and watch the snake be created.
